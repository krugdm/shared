Short description:

<p><strong>This is a Challenge Cache.  The cache is located at the posted coordinates, but in addition to signing the logbook, you must complete the challenge requirements before claiming an online find.</strong></p>
<p>You're looking for a small plastic container in the crook of a tree.</p>

Long description:

<p>This challenge was envisioned by <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=6527b08a-8cf0-47ba-8abb-42b859e596dd">bigcall</a> (and named by The Leprechauns) to honor Charter Members. To quote his original:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With over 6 million registered cachers there are less than 500 "Charter Members".  Charter Members are those cachers who were the first paid Premium Members back in the 2002 through early 2003 timeframe and who have maintained continuous paying membership since.   See the official definition <a href="https://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=182">here</a>. A post from the forums by Moun10Bike on 23 January 2014 puts the number at 491, (see: <a href="http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=304963&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=5344154">this post</a>), and it may continue to dwindle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To qualify for this challenge, you must find, or have found, caches that are owned by at least thirteen (13) different <strong>current</strong> Charter Members. This means that even though the owner may have been a Charter Member at one time, if they're no longer a Charter Member at the time you log your find, their caches are no longer eligible. Caches may be of any type, and it's okay if they've since been archived. This cache doesn't qualify for the challenge, although you can find <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/nearest.aspx?u=The+Cheeseheads">any others that belong to me</a>.</p>
<p>To help with this challenge, Moun10Bike has posted a list of active caches owed by charter members <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XgVQQQQVHx4W2cRZFuO6ZxHl1lZtuUYSRhRxre-zh54/edit#gid=0">here</a>. Fizzymagic has made two GSAK macros: one to <a href="http://www.fizzymagic.net/Geocaching/Info/Bigcall.gsk">check your finds</a> and another to <a href="http://www.fizzymagic.net/Geocaching/Info/CMFilter.gsk">identify unfound caches hidden by charter members</a>.</p>
<p>When you log your find, please provide a means of verification. For example, <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/bookmarks/view.aspx?guid=2bd6c7f0-56fe-4868-8109-edda55ffb0e7">here's a bookmark list</a> showing my qualifying finds.</p>
